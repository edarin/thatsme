# Background

To obtain high-resolution population estimates, [WorldPop](https://www.worldpop.org/) developed a top-down method that disagregates population totals into grid cells thanks to ancillary geospatial covariates.

The method consists in fitting a random-forest model [@breiman2001] at the finest administrative level for which population count is available. The estimated model is then used to predict population density for every grid cell thanks to the geospatial covariates. Finally, the predicted gridded population density layer plays the role of a weighting layer to breakdown the population totals into the grid cells [@stevens2015].

![Top-down disagregation model](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SLuYBPcAm59OnMwi7grsM2VzXkMx2JGH0616ZjP7JQD5waX1OMIfNTb3QX0KONaQjFBO9ZQPG7k_KU4yA3xoUxL0t4MTNK63z3f351ijJQ1PLtNhOfUywWhWj1JcPwD43EWwjMhfDnY)

The **geospatial covariates** commonly used by WorldPop initative for mapping population globally [@worldpopresearchgroup2018] are based[^1]:

1)  on resampled rasters

-   Resampled DMSP-OLS night-time lights 2000-2011

-   Resampled VIIRS night-time lights 2012-2016

-   SRTM-based elevation per country 2000

-   SRTM-based slope per country 2000

The input rasters have a resolution ranging from 900m to 90 m at the Equateur [@lloyd2019].

```

2)  on Euclidean distance measurement

-   Distance to European Space Agency Land cover categories

-   Distance to International Union for Conservation of Nature strict nature reserve and wilderness area edges

-   Distance to open-water coastline per country

-   Distance to OpenStreetMap (OSM) major roads, major road intersections and major waterways

Rasters resulting from Euclidian distance measurement can have virtually any spatial resolution. They however might not be representative of localized informative variations for population modelling.

```

heir distribution

The purpose of this post will be to study the impact of the building-footprint derived covariates on the modelling and subsequently on the gridded estimates in Sierra Leone.

# Data

Recently, WorldPop released openly gridded building patterns across entire sub-Saharan Africa at 100m resolution [@dooley2020]. These were derived from building footprints extracted from satellite imagery with a spatial accuracy of 6m [@ecopia.ai2019]. In top-down modelling, this data has already been used to produce an alternative global set of gridded population estimates constraining the estimates to settled grid cells[^2] [@bondarenko2020].

[^2]: Settled cells are cells containing at least one building footprint.
