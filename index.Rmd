I have been working for the past three years as first a research assistant, then a specialist research technician and now a research fellow at [WorldPop](https://www.worldpop.org/), University of Southampton. I build **Bayesian population models and maps** for sub-Saharan African countries combining household survey and satellite-imagery derived products.

I earned a MSc in applied **GIS and remote sensing** at the University of Southampton, where I wrote a thesis on deprived area mapping mobilising knowledge on quantitative geography, statistical modelling, and social sciences. Prior to that, I was trained in **statistics** (MSc from the ENSAE Paristech) and its **social sciences** application (Master at École Normale Supérieure de Cachan).

I applied my skills in the **academic** (Worldpop, University of Southampton), in the **humanitarian** (UN World Food Program) and in the **governmental** (Etalab, France) sectors always combining a strive for social justice and transparency with an indecent pleasure in playing with data.
