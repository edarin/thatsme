woprVision is an R shiny application that allows you to browse an interactive map to get population estimates for specific locations and demographic groups.

It has been developed for two reasons:

-   drawing function for easy interaction with gridded population for non GIS people

-   correct uncertainty estimates for spatial aggregates

woprVision is available on the web at <https://apps.worldpop.org/woprVision>.

Its source code is to be found here: <https://github.com/wpgp/wopr>

If run with local files, woprVision requires a SQLlite database with population prediction distribution for every grid cell and a tiled imgae of the gridded population.

On the internet, it runs on a shiny server and pings the WorldPop api.
