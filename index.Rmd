## Bio

I am currently a research assistant at WorldPop, University of Southampton, on **population modeling and mapping** in the GRID3 project.

Previously, I earned a MSc in applied GIS and Remote Sensing at the University of Southampton, where I wrote my thesis on deprived area mapping, a topic at the intersection between Geographic Information Systems, Statistical Modeling, and Social Sciences. I also have a strong background in Statistics (MSc from the ENSAE Paristech) and Social Sciences (Master at ENS Cachan) and their intrications.

I applied my skills in academia (Worldpop, University of Southampton), in humanitarian agency (UN World Food Program) and in governmental structure (Etalab, France) always combining a strive for social justice and transparency with an indecent pleasure in playing with data.
