Since 2024 I’ve been working as a Population Data Scientist on the NowPop project in Oxford’s Demographic Science Unit, where I model internal displacement in Ukraine using social‑media and mobile‑phone data.

In October 2022 I started a PhD at the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science, Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, focusing on **high‑resolution population estimates to support censuses in data‑limited settings**.

I hold an MSc in **applied GIS & remote sensing** from the University of Southampton (thesis: mapping deprivation in Kinshasa) and earlier degrees in **statistics** (ENSAE Paristech) and its **social‑science** applications (École Normale Supérieure de Cachan).

My experience spans:

* *Academia* – with WorldPop (University of Southampton) and the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science (University of Oxford)  
* *Humanitarian work* – with the UN World Food Programme, World Health Organisation, UN Fund for Population, UN High Commissioner for Refugees.  
* *Government* – with the Open Data Taskforce (France) and various Stats Offices (Burkina Faso, Mali, Brazil, Colombia).  

Across these roles I aim to combine a commitment to social justice and transparency with a practical interest in modelling complex data streams. In my own time, I’ve also helped develop a bike delivery cooperatives network as well as mutually owned housing‑cooperative business plans, gaining experience in finance and collaboration.
