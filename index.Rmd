## Bio

I have been working for the past three years as first a research assistant, then a specialist research technician and now a research fellow at [WorldPop](https://www.worldpop.org/), University of Southampton, building **Bayesian population models and maps** for sub-Saharan African countries using satellite-imagery derived products.

Previously, I earned a MSc in applied **GIS and remote sensing** at the University of Southampton, where I wrote a thesis on deprived area mapping intersecting quantitative geography, statistical modelling, and Social Sciences. I also have a strong background in **statistics** (MSc from the ENSAE Paristech) and **social sciences** application (Master at École Normale Supérieure de Cachan).

I applied my skills in **academia** (Worldpop, University of Southampton), in **humanitarian agency** (UN World Food Program) and in **governmental structure** (Etalab, France) always combining a strive for social justice and transparency with an indecent pleasure in playing with data.
